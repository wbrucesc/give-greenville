        <h1>What is Give Greenville?</h1>
        <p>
            Give Greenville is a community in Greenville, SC where you are free to give anything your heart desires and
            also ask freely for gifts from others without the exchange of money, exchanging items, or bartering! It's
            like the olden days when you went next door for a cup of sugar, just to a wider audience! It's an opportunity
            to give what you have and receive to keep items from the landfill! This is about the cycle of stuff and
            building a community of sharing.
        </p>

        <h1>Community Rules</h1>
        <p>
            We ask that you do not sell anything, do not promote your business
            (this includes not mentioning a business name), ask for money, no giving of live animals, and we will not
            deal with Firearms, Alcohol, Tobacco, or anything illegal. We only ask that you please be transparent with
            the giver if you are planning on re-selling their items prior to being selected. If you are not and we find
            you are re-selling, you will be removed from the group without warning. Please post your gift with one
            picture (this is required and additional ones can go in comments), a description, and your location so
            others know if they are willing to drive to you for the give. The giver can choose whoever they want to
            give to, make it fun! It's not first come first served. Please make all requests within the give posts and
            leave private messages for giving addresses only! PMs outside of this will get you banned from the group.
            This group is not for recommendations, job searches, or for finding housing. Also, please do not delete your
            posts! Leave them up and let us all see how much we are giving and building our community! Prior to your
            request being accepted, you must answer all three questions correctly and please be aware that #2 requires
            2 answers. Happy Giving and please invite your friends and neighbors!
        </p>

                        <p>
                            On each post, a user will be able to enter their name into consideration for either being chosen as the donor
                            on an Ask post or a recipient on a Give/Flash Give post. This is done by clicking the "Consider Me" button
                            on the post, adding a comment, and submitting the consideration.
                        </p>
                        <small>A user will not be able to enter a consideration on a post if they are not logged in, if they are the author
                            of that post, or if they have already entered a consideration.

                        <p>
                            Once a post has at least one consideration the author can manually choose a user to be the recipient or
                            donor for that post by selecting the "Choose" button below that user's consideration. If there are multiple
                            considerations on a post the author can also select a random user with the "Choose Random User" button.
                            This will choose a random user from the list of the considerations.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Connecting Author and Chosen User</h4>
                        <p>
                            When an author chooses a user on their post a few things happen. The post is marked as complete, the chosen
                            user is assigned to the post, and an email will be sent to the chosen user to begin direct communication.
                            The chosen user can reply to the email to directly communicate with the author of the post to coordinate
                            meetup time, location, etc.
